The Mobile Application will be going to include the following sections:
1) Contact & Helpline Information

## Solution  <br>
We used Android Studio for development of this App.Most of feature and data extraction is done using the API's provided by team Flipr.
We use following technologies:<br>
***Volley:** Volley is an HTTP library that makes networking for Android apps easier and most importantly, faster.<br>1.Automatic scheduling of network requests.<br>2.Support for request prioritization.<br>3.Cancellation request API. You can cancel a single request, or you can set blocks or scopes of requests to cancel.<br>
***MpChart:** This library is used for plotting graph from available data.<br>
***Recycler display:** This is used to display all the functions of all backend function on an App.<br>
***Intent:** It is a class in Android Studios which is used for redirecting the links.<br>
Intents are also used to transfer data between activities. Intents are used generally for starting a new activity using startActivity().<br>
